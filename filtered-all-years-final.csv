Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions),cost,avg_net_price.public,integer,Net-price-public,NPT4_PUB,,,IPEDS,"Shown/used on consumer website;    The average annual total cost of attendance (CostT4_A, CostT4_P), including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, minus the average grant/scholarship aid. It is calculated for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is included in the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For public institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram), this represents the net price for the full program. This metric is not available prior to the 2009-10 academic year.",,,
