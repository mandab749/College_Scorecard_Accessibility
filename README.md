# College_Scorecard_Accessibility
### Measuring the accessibility of colleges and universities to low-income students

Project by: Justin Harder-Tienken, Ashley Brockway, Manda Bucklin   


Using the College_Scorecard Dataset, we wanted to find schools that were most accessible to low-income students. We focused on the years '09-'18 and filtered for schools who were in each year.
We then created a function that measured the "burden" that was placed on each income group (which ranged from $0-30k to $110k+. Then, we evaluated the schools that placed low burdens on the low-income students. 

# Files  

- filtered_all_years.csv - the csv we primarily used for our project after filtering original data using sep_sheets.py
- some_function_testing.rmd - file used to view variance and burden of schools on low-income students
